This repos tries to use transformers as a kalman filter in
portoflio optimization. This idea is based on the folowwing


'''
Kalman filters can be used to optimize portfolios of assets in a way that considers the dynamics and correlations of the individual assets. This can be particularly useful in multi-asset portfolios, where Kalman filters can be used to estimate the assets' covariance matrix and optimize the portfolio subject to various constraints.
